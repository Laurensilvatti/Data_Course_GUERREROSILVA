# part 2

# 1. I dont think any of my models is right and I honestly am having a hard time interpreting the data. 

# 2.
# I am sure that if I plotted my data correcley I would have found exponential relationships. 
# to make this relationships linear I know you can turn the Y axis into a fuction of log()
  
  # 3.
